This workspace directory is intended as a convenient way to get
started writing InterAspect plug-ins.  Just write your plug-in as a C
file in this directory and compile it using the included Makefile.
The Makefile has pattern rules that let it compile any *.c into a
lib*.so plug-in file.

There is already a Hello World plug-in named hello.c.  You can compile
it with the make command:

make libhello.so
